# foodex2_code_meaning_app
This program takes an EFSA FoodEx2 code and returns its meaning.

This program is a complement to the search bar at https://data.food.gov.uk/codes/

At https://data.food.gov.uk/codes/ you can search for a food using its name. For example: **Chocolate/cocoa-based products**\
However you can't do a food search using its code: For example: **A0EQS**
